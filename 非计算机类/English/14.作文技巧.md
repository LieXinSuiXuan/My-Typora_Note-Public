范文：

①Seen from the chart, it can be concluded that American college students prefer to read popular novels father than read other kinds of books. Among all the books the students read now, popular novels account for 68.2% while unpopular fiction makes up 16. 8%,technical books 8. 3% and poems only 5.2%.

②It is no wonder that popular novels have attracted so many readers. They are written in plain language So that one can easily read them for entertainment or relaxation. Books of technology and collections of poems are less appealing in that the former is often complicated and the latter abstract.

③In my own practice, I think it not advisable at all to read popular novels. On the one hand, I spend much of my free time reading books in my specialized field-- environmental protection. On the other hand, I take great delight in reading nonfiction such as history and biography so as to be wiser and more reasonable. To turn my dream into reality, I must cherish every minute of my life and work hard.

（1）从图表中可以得出结论，美国大学生更喜欢读父亲的通俗小说，而不是阅读其他类型的书籍。在学生现在阅读的所有书籍中，通俗小说占68.2%，非通俗小说占16%。8%，技术书籍 8.3%，诗歌只有5.2%。

（2）难怪通俗小说吸引了这么多读者。它们以通俗易懂的语言编写，因此人们可以轻松阅读它们以进行娱乐或放松。技术书籍和诗集的吸引力较小，因为前者往往很复杂，而后者是抽象的。

（3）在我自己的实践中，我认为阅读通俗小说根本不可取。一方面，我把大部分空闲时间花在我的专业领域——环境保护上。另一方面，我非常喜欢阅读历史和传记等非小说类书籍，以便更明智、更合理。把我的梦想变成现实， 我一定要珍惜生命中的每一分钟，努力工作。
